                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi! I'm Xuan Bui. I'm a freshman at the University of Washington Bothell. This website is a portfolio website
                  which prepare for me to apply into the Interactive Media Design at UWB. I've been living in the US for more than two years.
                  I always appriciate that I got into UWB because I believe UWB can be a fundamental base for me to follow my dream. <br>
                  I started associate with art when I was 8 years old. At that time, I didn't have much interest when my mom took me to an art class for kids. 
                  I started with some basic drawing and painting with a penci and some crayons. I was a quiet kid (up until now) but had a creative mind. 
                  I created many art works with my imagination. And it follows me until know. I didn't know when I felt in love with art, I just knew that 
                  I attached to it and I wanted it to be a part of my life. I decided to follow the path as an art lover and now I am here. Besides traditional 
                  drawning and painting, I started learning digital art, photography, and coding (recently). I have to say that I'm a type of person that 
                  can do and will do anything I want. I never coded before, and when I took the first coding class (Java), I was shocked and thought that 
                  I would fail the class. However, I still made it. I think I have a strong will and mind that help me overcome any difficulties in my life.
